-------------------------LOCAL SETUP-------------------------

1• Create a new directory and name it 'build'. This will store the solution files.
	The build directory should be mentioned in the project's .gitignore to avoid
	pushing device-specific files.

2• Using CMake, build a Visual Studio Solution file on EACH device you want to develop it on.
	You will be asked to provide the directory containing the source files, select the entire folder.
	Specify build as the directory to store solution files.

	or

	Using a bash terminal, type in the following command whilst in the build directory:

		cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"

	The VS files should now be produced.
	If any files are missing, copy and paste them from an alternative source.

3• Open the solution and right click on MyGame.sln.
	Select 'Set as startup project'.
	Go to Properties > Linker > System and change the SubSystem to CONSOLE.

The project should run now.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Possible issues:

• The project may build fine, appear and then disappear suddenly.
This is caused by required resources (SFX, images, fonts, etc) being absent in the build folder.

• A C++ .gitignore specifies that compiled linker libraries (.dll, etc) are ignored.
This means you may have to import SDL2 manually on each device, as its libraries may not
be included from a pull as a result.

• All resources (SFX, images, fonts, etc) and .dll files must be included in the same diectory as the application's
executable (.exe) file in order for it to run.
